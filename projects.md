* **Theater Management system**, *ASU 2017*

   * Built the web application from scratch using python flask and MySQL. 
   * The database had a relational model with queries handling tasks like insertions, updates, deletions. Triggers and indexes were also used.
   * Generated the dummy data using python faker library.
   
---
* **Airbnb New User Bookings Prediction**, *ASU 2016*

   * Processed raw data, making it usable for further analysis using the python pandas library.
   * Performed feature engineering and statistical analysis of the data obtaining relevant insights using scikit-learn.
   * Implemented traditional classifiers and observed the accuracy. Tested blended ensemble of classifiers using multiple data sets.
   * Analyzed blended ensembles’ performance versus traditional classifiers

* **Naïve Bayes, K-NN, K-means implementation**, *ASU 2016*
   * Prepped raw data and realized the algorithms in python. Used numpy and matplotlib libraries

---
* **Stuttered Speech Recognition**, *VIT 2016*

   * Modified an existing algorithm to facilitate speech recognition for people suffering from stuttering.
   * Performed audio processing and stutter removal in Matlab.
   * Designed a neural network to learn from training samples to remove stutter from new test inputs in python, this new audio was then passed to the Google speech API to be recognized without the stutter.

* **Digit recognition using Matlab**, *VIT 2015*

   * Created a backward propagation neural network to recognize hand written digits using Matlab.
   * Used the MNIST database to train the neural net.

---
* **Game Development using Unreal Engine 4**, *VIT 2014*

   * Created an online/ LAN multi player 3rd person shooter game.
   * Worked on the back end to create the LAN capabilities and also made the various logics of the game ( like HP, teleportation and special moves).
   * [Watch the demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN54R70IJyU)

---
* **Game Development using Unreal Development Kit **, *VIT 2014*

   * Made two levels of a 3-D puzzler game.
   * Designed and constructed the levels along with game logics and back end scripting using UnrealScript.
   * [Watch the demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN8PgJOeTRU)

* **Propeller Clock**, *VIT 2014*

   * Based on persistence of vision. 
   * Created the propeller which has an array of LED's, which give the illusion of an actual clock.
   * Coded the IR sensor to detect RPM and change speed accordingly using an Arduino.

---
* **Notifier and Connectifier**, *VIT 2014*

   * Prototyped a cost effective Google glass alternative using the center piece of a Sony smart watch, basic principles of reflection and refraction. 
   * The frame was made using PVC pipes connected on top of a traditional spectacle frame.
   * Capacitive buttons on the the smart watch were extended using conductive fiber to give the user easy control.
   * The project was created in under 24 hours at a college hackathon.

---
* **Baby Vitals Monitoring**, *VIT 2014*

   * Developed an ingenious heart rate sensor using a plastic bottle cap and a ball point pen spring.
   * Used temperature sensor and developed a heart rate monitor as well. 
   * All these were connected using bluetooth using Zigbee and utilizing the power of the Arduino board. 
   * The readings were visible on a simple mobile app. 
   * This device was made at a hackathon organized by CAMTech.
