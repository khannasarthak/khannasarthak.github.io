* **Theatre Management system**, *ASU 2017*

   * Built the web app from scratch using python flask and MySQL. 
   * The database had a relational model with queries handling tasks like insertions, updates, deletions. Triggers and indexes were also used.
   * Generated the dummy data using pyhton faker library.

* **Airbnb New User Bookings Prediction**, *ASU 2016*

   * Processed raw data, making it usable for further analysis using the python pandas library.
   * Performed feature engineering and statistical analysis of the data obtaining relevant insights using scikit-learn.
   * Implemented traditional classifiers and observed the accuracy. Tested blended ensemble of classifiers using multiple data sets.
   * Analysed blended ensembles’ performance versus traditional classifiers

* **Naïve Bayes, K-NN, K-means implementation**, *ASU 2016*
   * Prepped raw data and realized the algorithms in python. Used numpy and matplotlib libraries

---
* **Stuttered Speech Recognition**, *VIT 2016*

   * Modified an existing algorithm to facilitate speech recognition for people suffering from stuttering.
   * Performed audio processing and stutter removal in Matlab.
   * Designed a neural network to learn from training samples to remove stutter from new test inputs in python, this new audio was then passed to the Google speech API to be recognised without the stutter.

* **Digit recognition using Matlab**, *VIT 2015*

   * Created a backward propagation neural network to recognize hand written digits using Matlab.
   * Used the MNIST databse to train the neural net.
