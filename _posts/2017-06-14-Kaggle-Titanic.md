Setting up the jupyter notebook took some time. Commands to change the working directory of the notebook are as follows:

```python
import os
os.getcwd()
os.chdir('D:/Github Repos/My-Kaggle-Solutions/Titanic/Refresh') #replace with your directory that contains the files
```

WIll be putting up links for the notebook or the code repo soon.
