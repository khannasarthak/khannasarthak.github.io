Code everyday for atleast 4 hours doing questions from leet code, geek for geeks or algorithmic implementations. This will be a sort of personal blog writing my daily progress and if possible waka time images. Also, start another post for helpful python tips that I can refer later on.

### **Day 29** [08/14]

Finally back to coding after the long journey to the US.

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [three-great-candidates](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-great-candidates/0)

### **Day 30** [08/18]

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [reach-the-nth-point](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reach-the-nth-point/0)

	DP problem, was actually just hidden Fibonacci. 

* [is-square](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/is-square/0)

	A modified question that I had already solved earlier.

* [max-value](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-value/0)
* [search-in-a-rotated-array](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-rotated-array/0)

	had done a similar question before, but got stuck again. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/). Try it again.

### **Day 31** [08/19]

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [column-name-from-a-given-column-number](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/column-name-from-a-given-column-number/0)

	Finally solved this question, the mistake I was making was treating A as 1. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-excel-column-name-given-number/)

* [find-all-pairs-whose-sum-is-x](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-all-pairs-whose-sum-is-x/0)

	Brute force worked easily. Will try for another solution less than O(n^2). Editorial using Hashing [here.](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-two-unsorted-arrays-find-pairs-whose-sum-x/)

### **Day 32** [08/20]

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [rotation](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotation/0)

	Solved in O(nlogn), im sure can solve it in O(n). However, im unable to get a solution using binary search, the duplicates mess up the answer. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-rotation-count-rotated-sorted-array/) does not take duplicates into account.
