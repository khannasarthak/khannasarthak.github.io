title: Coding Challenge : Week 1
categories: coding
---

Code everyday for atleast 4 hours doing questions from leet code, geek for geeks or algorithmic implementations. This will be a sort of personal blog writing my daily progress and if possible waka time images. Also, start another post for helpful python tips that I can refer later on.

**GOALS**
* 150 Leet code problems (30/150)

### **Day 0**

* Leetcode [30] : 557, 500, 561, 506

The questions were good, learnt a few new tricks using dictionaries. Feels good to start coding again after a long break. 

506:
```python
new_dict = dict(zip(key,value))
print (list(map(dik.get, nums))) # where nums can be a list of keys, and this returns values  
```

500:
```python
new_list = list1 + list2 # not a deep copy.
```
