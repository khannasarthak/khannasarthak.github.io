Code everyday for atleast 4 hours doing questions from leet code, geek for geeks or algorithmic implementations. This will be a sort of personal blog writing my daily progress and if possible waka time images. Also, start another post for helpful python tips that I can refer later on.

**GOALS**
* 150 Leet code problems (42/150)

### **Day 8** [07/08]

**Leetcode:** [198], [575]

198:

Similar to dynamic programming problem done yesterday. Need to study more DP.

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [permutations-of-a-given-string](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/permutations-of-a-given-string/0)

Try to do this without itertools and use backtracking. [Refer this](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-program-to-print-all-permutations-of-a-given-string/)

* [find-first-and-last-occurrence-of-x](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-first-and-last-occurrence-of-x/0)

Good question , learnt a new way to find all indices of an element in list
```python

n = int(input())
indices = [i for i, x in enumerate(k) if x == n]    # n is the element whos indices are being found
```

* [k-largest-elements](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/k-largest-elements/0)
* [rotate-array-by-n-elements](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotate-array-by-n-elements/0)
* [value-equal-to-index-value](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/value-equal-to-index-value/0)

Have to start doing CTCI and backtracking. Also, work on the linux script to send updates on the desktop automatically.
