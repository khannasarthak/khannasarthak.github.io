### **Day 29** [08/14]

Finally back to coding after the long journey to the US.

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [three-great-candidates](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/three-great-candidates/0)

### **Day 30** [08/18]

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [reach-the-nth-point](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/reach-the-nth-point/0)

	DP problem, was actually just hidden Fibonacci. 

* [is-square](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/is-square/0)

	A modified question that I had already solved earlier.

* [max-value](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/max-value/0)
* [search-in-a-rotated-array](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/search-in-a-rotated-array/0)

	had done a similar question before, but got stuck again. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/). Try it again.

### **Day 31** [08/19]

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [column-name-from-a-given-column-number](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/column-name-from-a-given-column-number/0)

	Finally solved this question, the mistake I was making was treating A as 1. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-excel-column-name-given-number/)

* [find-all-pairs-whose-sum-is-x](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-all-pairs-whose-sum-is-x/0)

	Brute force worked easily. Will try for another solution less than O(n^2). Editorial using Hashing [here.](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-two-unsorted-arrays-find-pairs-whose-sum-x/)

### **Day 32** [08/20]

**GeekforGeeks**:
* [rotation](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/rotation/0)

	Solved in O(nlogn), im sure can solve it in O(n). However, im unable to get a solution using binary search, the duplicates mess up the answer. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-rotation-count-rotated-sorted-array/) does not take duplicates into account.

### **Day 33** [08/21]

Planning to make an AI assistant using python, did a lot of digging around articles, wolframalpha API along with wikipedia should give me a prototype soon. Can also implement voice recog using google voice api. 

Also, will be switching to ubuntu as my main operatin system for the next few days. Using windows only to study or to sync up class notes.

Will create a new post regarding the AI assistant. Wont be able to code as much as before since the classes have started. But I'll keep solving questions whenever I can and also work on the side projects.

### **Day 34** [08/25]

**Leetcode**:

* [657. Judge Route Circle](https://leetcode.com/problems/judge-route-circle/description/)

**GeekforGeeks**:

* [smallest-positive-missing-number](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/smallest-positive-missing-number/0)

	Good question, need to create an array to store location of positive numbers that have occured. And just print the one where count is 0. [Editorial](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-smallest-positive-number-missing-from-an-unsorted-array/)

* [even-and-odd-elements-at-even-and-odd-positions](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/even-and-odd-elements-at-even-and-odd-positions/0)

	I used 2 more arrays to store the intermediete even/odd numbers. Can maybe do it while iterating itself. Time complexity is O(n). [Editorial](http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/editorial.php?pid=2345)
